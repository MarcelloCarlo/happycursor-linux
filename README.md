Happy Cursors made by [@CircleToonsHD](https://x.com/CircleToonsHD)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.

```bash

git clone https://github.com/MarcelloCarlo/happycursor-linux.git

cd happycursor-linux

```

2. Copy the `happycursor-linux` folder to your `.icon` folder. Choose between for your user or system-wide.

```bash

## For your user only
~/.icons
## For system-wide
/usr/share/icons

```

  3. Depending on your desktop environment, choose the **happycursor-linux** as the cursor icons.

## Notes

- I used [win2xcur](https://github.com/quantum5/win2xcur) to convert the files.
- This works on GNOME 48 (Fedora 42) and used GNOME Tweaks to change the cursor icons.
- If you want some changes, you can fork this repo.
- Icons were made by [@CircleToonsHD](https://x.com/CircleToonsHD), ask them if you want some requests.
